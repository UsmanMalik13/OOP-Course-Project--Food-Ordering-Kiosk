Developed OOP course project in java with GUI using Swing Library.

# Restaurant Ordering System

This project is a Restaurant Ordering System designed to streamline the ordering process for both customers and restaurant staff. With this system, customers can conveniently place orders without waiting for waitstaff during busy hours, reducing errors and improving efficiency. The system leverages core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, providing a robust, user-friendly experience.

## Introduction
Dining out is increasingly popular as people often prefer not to cook after long work hours or while juggling university assignments and activities. Traditional ordering methods, where waitstaff take orders and pass them to the kitchen, are prone to delays, errors, and inefficiencies, particularly during peak times. 

This Restaurant Ordering System addresses these issues by allowing customers to place orders directly through an interactive system. This self-service approach helps speed up the ordering process, reduces errors, and enhances the overall customer experience.

## Project Objectives
- **Ease of Ordering:** Enable customers to place their orders quickly and easily.
- **Enhanced Service Quality:** Improve the restaurant's service quality by reducing wait times and order errors.
- **Minimized Human Effort:** Streamline the ordering process to reduce the workload on waitstaff and kitchen staff.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Provide a clear and intuitive interface that delivers up-to-date menu information.
- **Reduced Staff Requirements:** Decrease the need for counter staff, especially during peak times.
- **Error Minimization:** Implement an automated ordering system to reduce common mistakes in order processing.

## Features
- **Self-Service Ordering:** Customers can browse the menu and place orders directly, without waiting for staff assistance.
- **Efficient Order Management:** Orders are sent directly to the kitchen, reducing delays and human errors.
- **Real-Time Menu Updates:** Allows for easy updates to menu items, pricing, and availability.
- **Automated Billing:** The system generates a bill automatically, minimizing billing errors.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple navigation and clean design to enhance customer satisfaction.

## System Design
The system employs key OOP concepts, including:
- **Inheritance:** Used for creating item categories (e.g., beverages, meals) and their subtypes (e.g., tea, coffee, burger, pizza).
- **Polymorphism:** Allows dynamic selection of item-specific behaviors within the system.
- **Association (Has-A relationship):** Links GUI components to item classes for seamless interaction.
- **Encapsulation:** Protects sensitive data and improves modularity.
- **Abstraction:** Simplifies complex processes, making the system easy to understand and maintain.
- **File Handling:** Manages data storage and retrieval efficiently, keeping track of orders and menu details.
- **Exception Handling:** Ensures system reliability by handling input errors and unexpected events gracefully.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **GUI Framework:** Tkinter or PyQt (for a graphical interface)
- **Data Storage:** File handling techniques for order and menu management
